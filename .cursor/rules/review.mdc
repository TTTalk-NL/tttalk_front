# Review Instructions

## Code Quality

- Prefer early returns. It is recommended to throw/return early so we can ensure null-checks and prevent further nesting.
- Prefer Composition over Prop Drilling. Instead of relying on prop drilling, let's try to take advantage of react children feature.
- Always use t() for text localization in frontend code; direct text embedding should trigger a warning.
- Check if there are circular references introduced. We should never allow these.
- Flag excessive Day.js use in performance-critical code. Functions like `.add`, `.diff`, `.isBefore`, and `.isAfter` are slow, especially in timezone mode. Prefer `.utc()` for better performance. Where possible, replace with native Date and direct `.valueOf()` comparisons for faster execution. Recommend using native methods or Day.js `.utc()` consistently in hot paths like loops.
